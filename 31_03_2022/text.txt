schedular are important more than cpu as it has its own algoritham 
memmory management deaals with virtuaal management and its dealing with ram 

system calls do not belong touser space they are kernal specific user function they are invoke from the user space to call apropriate kernal services each and every system call 
passes through a thin layer between user space and kernal space called as system call interface 

each and every system call has a specific defination in kernal space on this specific defination is call on a system call invocation 

each and every device have its own device drivers 

device driver is a piece of software that concates with the  hardware that manages the hardware and brings the functionality of the end device of the user 
a device from os POV resides in the kernal space bcoz only in the kernal space driver has uderline priveleges to talk to comunicate with the hard ware
application ->  device driver -> hardwatre 

driver hs 2 interfaces 1 is application intraction and other is intraction with hardware 
intraction is purely linux kernal os 
device driver deals with hardware that is hardware based
