SIGNALS  they are software intrupts they are also notification to the processes that inform some event occurs 
they are ashyncronus in nature that can happen any time 
process with inuff permision can send signal to another process or else it can send signal to it self also 
most of the time process gets signal from kernal an cpu


APPLICATION OF SIGNALS 
they are used for syncronizing in case of semaphore locks it also provide unlocking applications 
difference between mutex and semaphore is semaphoresends the signal 


we have a function and command both as kill 
but command kill is used to kill the signal using function
kill sends a signal to the process and also to killl the process terminating in the background

writer writing into the pipe with out havaing a reader then kernal notify that there is no reader

when clock set by allaram expieres a signal call seek alrm in generated 

SIGURG1/SIGURG=2 ->these signals are used by the system 

signals are the event that are to notified to process they can be from cpu kernal or any software running on the cpu.

hardware signal-> events trigered by the external components other than cpu.

on a network device a network packet arrive they will triggered the intrupt to the cpu and it runts appropriate network driver and ask to receive and process the packet

when ready to transmit over the network device triger interrupt to CPU and CPU runs appropriate network driver and say to please transmit the packet

insted of execting a defult function user can run user define function before that user has to installed or established a signal handler 
it is used to notify the kernal to execute a user define function whn a signal is deliverd 

when signal is sent to process any of these 3 actions can be generated:
1)default action
2)ignore action
3)user-defined action
SIGNAL HANDLER:
Installing/establishing the user defined function:
instead of executing a default action a user can run user defined function before that user has to establish or install the signal handler. signal handler is to notify the kernel to execute a user defined function when a signal is delivered.
Signal handler syntax:
void*(signal(int signal_number, void *function()))(int);Signal function takes 2 args. 1st is signal number and 2nd is function pointer that is executes a user defined function. signal function itself is a function pointer that takes single integer and returs void
